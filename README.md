Initially I was very interested in learning about speech recognition technologies. And when the chance to implement it, I created a web application in which one can upload audio files and this audio file is sent to a nodejs server on the backend. To add complexity and learn about flask as well I created an API call to a flask server where I sent the audio file.

Used google speech recognition library to convert the audio file to text and send it back to the user.
